# Xcode

Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the App store or the Apple developer website.

_**If installed Xcode already, no need to run the command below**_

For installing Xcode command line tools run the command

```
    xcode-select --install
```

It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and now you have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed and running.

Also install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/) for X11 server and client libraries for OS X Mountain Lion.
