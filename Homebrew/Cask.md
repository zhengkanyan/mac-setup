# Homebrew Cask

Let's see if we can get the elegance, simplicity, and speed of Homebrew for the installation and management of GUI Mac applications such as Google Chrome and Adium.

### Install

As of December 2015, cask comes installed with Homebrew directly.

```
$ brew cask install google-chrome
```

### Search

It is really simple to check if the app is supported by cask by going to the search page on [caskroom.io](http://caskroom.io/)

### Quick look plugins

Some [plugins](https://github.com/sindresorhus/quick-look-plugins) to enable different files to work with Mac Quicklook. Includes features like syntax highlighting, markdown rendering, preview of jsons, patch files, csv, zip files etc.

```
$ brew cask install qlcolorcode
$ brew cask install qlstephen
$ brew cask install qlmarkdown
$ brew cask install quicklook-json
$ brew cask install qlprettypatch
$ brew cask install quicklook-csv
$ brew cask install betterzipql
$ brew cask install webpquicklook
$ brew cask install suspicious-package
```
